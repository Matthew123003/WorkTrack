The useRouter hook from expo-router is a powerful utility that allows you to programmatically navigate between screens in an Expo project. It is part of the expo-router library, which integrates routing into Expo projects using a file-based routing system similar to Next.js.
Key Points about useRouter

    Purpose:
        The hook provides a router object with methods to navigate between routes (screens) in your app.
        It simplifies navigation by removing the need to pass navigation props through components.

    Common Methods:
        router.push(path): Navigates to a new screen, adding the route to the navigation stack.
        router.replace(path): Replaces the current screen with a new one in the navigation stack.
        router.back(): Navigates back to the previous screen in the stack.
        router.prefetch(path): Preloads the screen for the specified route (useful for optimizing navigation).
        router.setParams(params): Updates query parameters for the current route.

    File-Based Routing:
        expo-router automatically sets up routes based on the file structure of your project.
        Example: If you have pages/home.tsx, you can navigate to the "home" screen using router.push('/home').

Advantages of useRouter

    Declarative Navigation:
        You can handle navigation without needing to use navigation props explicitly.
    Dynamic Routes:
        Easily handle dynamic parameters like /user/[id].
        Example: Navigate with a parameter:

        router.push('/user/123');

    Intuitive API:
        The API is straightforward and similar to routing in web frameworks like React Router or Next.js.

Summary

The useRouter hook simplifies navigation in an Expo project by 
providing a clean and programmatic way to manage routes. It works 
seamlessly with the file-based routing system of expo-router, making
 your app's navigation intuitive and efficient.
